# Connect Four - KI

This assignment is about a program that plays Connect Four (check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four or whatever source you like). 
Actually we obtained a Java code from 1999 which already uses MinMaxPlayer and some alpha-beta pruning. There are some flaws which we will improve. Moreover we will do some performance measurements.
